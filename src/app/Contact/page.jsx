                {`\u2001`}{`\u2001`}{`\u2001`}My name is Pichaiyut Sirianantawong. I am a developer using Javascript, HTML, 
                CSS, REACT, Next.JS and REACT Native. I used to be .Net programmer before. However, I found out that Javascript
                and its library and framework are more interesting than dot Net. That&apos;s why I switch to learn the subjects.
                Finally, I need to create a web application using Next.JS for my graduation project.<br/><br/>

                and web application. Firstly, I would like to work on Freelancer.com. In fact, I will try to be a freelance on the other
                platforms too. Thank you for checking out my graduation project. I hope you enjoy testing it.<br/><br/>
